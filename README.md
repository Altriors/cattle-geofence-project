## Overview

Traditional cattle monitoring depends on manual supervision, which is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unscalable. This system eliminates that dependency by combining computer vision with cloud infrastructure to provide automated, real-time boundary monitoring.

When a camera detects cattle crossing a predefined virtual boundary, the system stores an alert in Firebase Firestore and immediately dispatches a push notification to the farmer's mobile device via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

---

## System Architecture

The system is composed of two subsystems:

**Backend Detection Engine**
- Captures live video from CCTV/IP cameras using OpenCV
- Runs YOLOv8 inference per frame for cattle detection
- Applies virtual geo-fence boundary validation
- Uploads violation alerts to Firebase Firestore
- Triggers push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging

**Flutter Mobile Application**
- User authentication and session management
- Real-time alert display and incident management
- Dashboard statistics and alert history
- Push notification handling and acknowledgement

## Firestore Alert Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| timestamp | Timestamp | Time of boundary violation |
| cattle_count | Integer | Number of cattle detected |
| cattle_id | Integer | Optional tracked cattle identifier |
| boundary_crossed | Boolean | Violation status |
| camera | String | Camera source identifier |
| resolved | Boolean | Alert acknowledgement status |

---

## Requirements

**Software**
- Python 3.10+
- Flutter SDK
- Firebase CLI
- VS Code or PyCharm
- Git

**Hardware (Development)**
- Processor: Intel i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 or higher
- RAM: 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended)
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU recommended for training

**Hardware (Deployment)**
- CCTV or IP camera at farm boundary
- Android or iOS smartphone
- Active internet connection

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Altriors/cattle-geofence-project.git
cd cattle-geofence-project
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Backend

Before running, ensure the following are in place:

- Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON is configured in the backend directory
- YOLOv8 model weights (`best.pt`) are placed in `backend/models/`
- A webcam, CCTV, or IP camera is connected and accessible

```bash
python backend/scripts/live_camera.py
```

The backend will begin real-time detection, apply geo-fence validation, and push alerts to Firestore on boundary violations.

---

## Running the Mobile Application

```bash
cd mobile_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Ensure the following Firebase configuration files are present before running:

- `google-services.json` — for Android (`android/app/`)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` — for iOS (`ios/Runner/`)

---

## How It Works

1. Camera captures a continuous live video feed from the farm boundary
2. Each frame is processed in real time using YOLOv8
3. Detected cattle are bounded and their positions recorded
4. Geo-fencing logic checks detected positions against the virtual boundary
5. A violation is confirmed after detection across multiple consecutive frames
6. Alert data is written to Firebase Firestore
7. A push notification is dispatched to the farmer via FCM
8. The Flutter application displays the alert on the dashboard

| IoT / LoRaWAN Tracking | Medium | Yes | No | Required |
| YOLO + Camera Only | Low | No | No | Not Required |

## Future Scope

- Individual cattle identification and tracking using deep learning
- Multi-camera centralized monitoring with alert aggregation
- Edge deployment on Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson
- Offline functionality for low-connectivity environments
- Night vision and thermal imaging support
- Analytics dashboard for cattle movement pattern analysis
